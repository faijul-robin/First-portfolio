<p>HTML is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers</a> use to interpret and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting">compose</a> text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_top">operating system</a>: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"
>SGML</a> concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">HTML</a> has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
