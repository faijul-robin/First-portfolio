<p>Okay, so this is the only bit of <em>mandatory</em> theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.</p>

<p>HTML is the <b>language in which most websites are written</b>. <strong>HTML</strong> is used to create pages and make them <i>functional</i>.</p>

<p>The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. <small>For now</small>, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.</p>

<p>I practrices <strong>basic html tags</strong> that i learned from progrmming hero web developmetn course</p>


    <p>paragraph tag</p>
    <p><b>bold tag</b></p>
    <p><strong>bold tag that is symantic</strong></p>
    <p><i>italic tag</i></p>
   <p> <em>italic tag that is symentic</em></p>
    <p><small>small tag</small></p>
